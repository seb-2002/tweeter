# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above
- Body-parser
- Chance

## Functionality

Tweeter is a locally-hosted app. That means that tweets will be saved in the system only as long as the server is kept running.

Tweeter is in the beta stage, meaning there are still a few bugs. We would love to hear about any bugs you find. You can email the developers at sebastiankann@gmail.com.

Tweeter has two layouts: one is intended for desktop computers, and the other for mobile devices. Make sure you try both for the full experience!
